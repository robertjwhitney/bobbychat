# BobbyChat

## Background

Just for fun. Mostly I wanted to finally build something using React, and I realized I had never really been indoctrinated into the hall of node-based-chat-apps. There aren't a lot of tests, I'm sure I could fix a bunch of things, see the list of issues for stuff I'd like to do but might not ever have the time for haha.

## Setup

To install dependencies: `npm install`

Redis should also be installed and running.

To run the server:

`foreman start`

or

`npm run server`

To compile any front-end changes: 

`npm run build`

To run tests:

`npm run test`
